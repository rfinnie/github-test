Changes for 1.5.2a
------------------
*) Only enable keep alive from CGI scripts with content lengths and if
   keep alive is enabled on the server
*) Delete preceding white space on CGI headers

   with HTTP, now responds with HTTP/1.0 which is spec)
*) Added SERVER_ROOT CGI var
*) Should escape # character in directory indexing
*) Add MaxRequestsPerChild support, so that errors in state can be swept under

   before attempting to see them

*) Added FCGI support from Openmarket
*) Added support for Linux 2.0

   for non full path urls in the map file
*) A couple logging functions didn't check reqInfo->remote_name for a NULL
*) change getuid to geteuid in httpd.c so that effectively root people can
   start the server and have it change uids
*) Slight code rearrangement to make Redirects from .htaccess more 
   useful because the file doesn't have to exist. 
*) Added support for restricted access by Referer field
*) Added OnDeny command for Limit directive which allows a redirect on
   failure (esp. useful for denying by referer)

*) remove path_args/path_alias crap, and put it in reqInfo structure
*) Why do we require full URLs in Redirect?  A local (root) url should work fine
*) Redirect from .htaccess should work now (completely)
*) Added hack to allow SSI of CGI, at a great expense of speed (CGI_SSI_HACK)
