live-build (1:20180411) unstable; urgency=medium

  The live-boot mount points have been moved from /lib/live/mount to
  /run/live. Since this is a backward-incompatible change, a compat
  recursive bind mount point is being provided in /lib/live/mount so
  that existing scripts will not break in Debian 10 (Buster).
  Please note that this will be removed in Debian 11 (Bullseye) so
  plan accordingly and update any required scripts.
